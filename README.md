# CoinDeskiOSApp
<br />
The app is using CoinDesk API to be able to fetch bitcoin price by it's currency. 
I have used Storyboard for one part of the app and programmatic constraints for the second. So I can show both parts of work.

## Features

- [x] The currencies, coin list fetched succesfully from the API using combine.
- [x] Used Codable for currencies and coinlist. 
- [x] Implemented programmatic constraints & Storyboard. 
## Installation

- Clone or download zip of the repository and go to your terminal.
